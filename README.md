Neighbors can be exposed to carcinogenic wood dust from mulch centers, as handling and processing organic materials like wood chips releases fine dust into the air.

Wood dust is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), linked primarily to cancers of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.
